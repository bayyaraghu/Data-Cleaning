----- Combining Data ------

1. 5 Million row dataset may be broken into 5 saperate datasets
2. Easier to store and share
3. May have new data for each day
4. Important to be able to combine then clean, or vice versa

------- Finding and Concatenating Data ---------

 ---concatenating many files ----
 
 1. Leverage python's features with data cleaning in pandas
 2. In order to concatenate DataFrame :
    a. They must be in a list
    b. Can individually load if there are a few datasets
    c. But what if there are thousands?
3. Solution  : glob function to find files based on a pattern

------ Globbing ----------

1. Pattern matching for file names
2. Wildcars : *?
   a. Any csv file : *.csv
   b. Any single character: file_?.csv
3. Return a list of file names
4. Can use this list to load into seperate dataframes

--- Convering Data types ---
--- Categorical Data ----
1. Converting categorical data to 'category' dtype:
   a. can make the Dataframe samller in memory
   b. can make them be utilized by other python libraries for analysis
   
----- String Manipulation ------
1. Much of data clearning involves string manipulation
   a. Most of the worlds data is unstructured text
2. Also have to do string manipulation to make datasets consistent with one another

---- Validate Values ---- Example match
1. 17 = \d*,  2. $17 = \$\d* , 3. $17.89 = \$\d*\.\d*, 4. $17.89 = \$\d*\.\d{2}

---- String Manipulation -----
1. Many build-in and external libraries
2. 're' library for regular expressions
    a. A formal way of specifying a pattern
    b. Sequence of characters
3. Pattern matching
    a. similar to globbing
    
------ Using Regular expressions -------

1. Complile the pattern
2. Use the compiled pattern to match values
3. This lets us use the pattern over and over again
4. Useful since we want to match values down a column of values
